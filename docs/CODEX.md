## Codex Overlay

This is the canonical Codex overlay used by the README install command.
Use it for Android/iOS/KMP review packets only.

1. Prefer first-class batch runs: `desloppify review --run-batches --runner codex --parallel --scan-after-import`.
2. The command writes immutable packet snapshots under `.desloppify/review_packets/holistic_packet_*.json`; use those for reproducible retries.
3. Keep reviewer input scoped to the immutable packet and the Android/iOS/KMP source files named in each batch.
4. Do not use prior chat context, score history, narrative summaries, issue labels, or target-threshold anchoring while scoring.
5. Assess every dimension listed in `query.dimensions`; never drop a requested dimension. If evidence is weak/mixed, score lower and explain uncertainty in findings.
6. Return machine-readable JSON only for review imports. For Claude session submit (`--external-submit`), include `session` from the generated template:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "id": "<session_id_from_template>",
    "token": "<session_token_from_template>"
  },
  "assessments": {
    "<dimension_from_query>": 0
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "dimension": "<dimension_from_query>",
      "identifier": "short_id",
      "summary": "one-line defect summary",
      "related_files": ["composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/HomeScreen.kt"],
      "evidence": ["specific code observation"],
      "suggestion": "concrete fix recommendation",
      "confidence": "high|medium|low"
    }
  ]
}
```

7. `findings` MUST match `query.system_prompt` exactly (including `related_files`, `evidence`, and `suggestion`). Use `"findings": []` when no defects are found.
8. Import is fail-closed by default: if any finding is invalid/skipped, `desloppify review --import` aborts unless `--allow-partial` is explicitly passed.
9. Assessment scores are auto-applied from trusted internal run-batches imports, or via Claude cloud session imports (`desloppify review --external-start --external-runner claude` then printed `--external-submit`). Legacy attested external import via `--attested-external` remains supported.
10. Manual override is safety-scoped: you cannot combine it with `--allow-partial`, and provisional manual scores expire on the next `scan` unless replaced by trusted internal or attested-external imports.
11. If a batch fails, retry only that slice with `desloppify review --run-batches --packet <packet.json> --only-batches <idxs>`.
