## Cursor Overlay

Cursor supports native subagents via `.cursor/agents/` definitions. Use them
for context-isolated subjective reviews.
Use this overlay for Android/iOS/KMP repositories.

### Parallel review

Split dimensions across subagents so each reviewer scores independently.
Define a reviewer agent in `.cursor/agents/desloppify-reviewer.md`:

```markdown
---
name: desloppify-reviewer
description: Scores subjective codebase quality dimensions for desloppify
tools:
  - read
  - search
---

You are a code quality reviewer. You will be given a codebase path, a set of
dimensions to score, and what each dimension means for an Android/iOS/KMP
repository. Read the code, score each dimension 0-100 from evidence only, and
return JSON in the required format. Do not anchor to target thresholds. When
evidence is mixed, score lower and explain uncertainty.
```

Workflow:
1. Read `dimension_prompts` from `query.json` for dimension definitions.
2. Launch multiple reviewer subagents, each with a subset of dimensions.
3. Each agent writes its output to a separate file.
4. Merge assessments (average where dimensions overlap) and findings.
5. Preferred local path (Codex runner): `desloppify review --run-batches --runner codex --parallel --scan-after-import`.
6. Cursor/cloud/manual path:
   - robust session flow (recommended): `desloppify review --external-start --external-runner claude`; use generated `claude_launch_prompt.md` + `review_result.template.json`, then run printed `desloppify review --external-submit --session-id <id> --import <file>`
   - durable scored import (legacy): `desloppify review --import findings.json --attested-external --attest "I validated this review was completed without awareness of overall score and is unbiased."`
   - findings-only fallback: `desloppify review --import findings.json`

### Review integrity

1. Do not use prior chat context, score history, or target-threshold anchoring while scoring.
2. Score from evidence only; when evidence is mixed, score lower and explain uncertainty.
3. Return machine-readable JSON only for review imports. For `--external-submit`, include `session` from the generated template:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "id": "<session_id_from_template>",
    "token": "<session_token_from_template>"
  },
  "assessments": {
    "naming_quality": 0,
    "error_consistency": 0,
    "abstraction_fit": 0,
    "logic_clarity": 0,
    "ai_generated_debt": 0
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "dimension": "naming_quality",
      "identifier": "short_id",
      "summary": "one-line defect summary",
      "related_files": ["iosApp/Features/Home/HomeView.swift"],
      "evidence": ["specific code observation"],
      "suggestion": "concrete fix recommendation",
      "confidence": "high|medium|low"
    }
  ]
}
```
4. `findings` MUST match `query.system_prompt` exactly. Use `"findings": []` only when no defects are found.
5. Import is fail-closed by default: invalid/skipped findings abort `desloppify review --import` unless `--allow-partial` is explicitly passed.
6. Assessment scores are auto-applied from trusted internal run-batches imports, or via Claude cloud session imports (`--external-start` + printed `--external-submit`). Legacy attested external import via `--attested-external` remains supported.
